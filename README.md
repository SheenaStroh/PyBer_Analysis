# PyBer Ride-Share Analysis

## Overview
After the original analaysis was complete a new summary of the data was requested. This analysis looks at the same ride-sharing data as the first, but now the data will be split up by city type and a summary created. This data shows several trends that are based on the city type, which can inform the company on what they can do to address these differences.

## Results
The following table addresses the difference in various data points grouped by city type.

This table is focused on 5 different data points for each city type.
- The total rides per city type show that rural cities have significantly fewer rides than either urban or suburban city types. This makes sense as there are fewer people in rural areas, as well as fewer places to go on average, though the difference is more stark than expected.
- The total drivers per city type show the same general trend, rural cities have far fewer drivers than urban or suburban cities, but here the difference is even steeper than it is for total rides.
- As expected, the total fares follow the same pattern, urban cities take up a significant percentage of the overall fare totals for the city types.
- When we get to the average fare per ride, this is where the trend shifts. For rural cities each ride costs more than urban or suburban cities. 
- The average fare per driver continues this shifted trend, with rural cities having a much higher average per driver than either urban or suburban cities.

The final data point is looking at the Total Fare by City Type over time.

This data shows that the trends in total fare are similar for all three city types, that is the amounts the fares change follow a very similar pattern, it's just that the rural city fares are less than the suburban city fares, which are both less than the urban city fares.

## Summary
Overall there is absolutely a noticable disparity between the three different city types and their PyBer ride-sharing data. One recommendataion based on this data would be to attempt to increase the number of drivers in rural cities. The other city types have a much lower ratio of rides to drivers, so there is a chance that with more drivers there could be more total rides completed. Another recommendation would be to lower the cost of the rides in rural areas. The combination of more drivers and cheaper rides would likely lead to an increase in usuage of the system. One final recommendation would be to increase the costs of the urban cities rides. The rural and suburban data shows that people will pay higher prices to utilize the ride-sharing system, the company should take advantage of that in Urban cities where utlization is already higher than other areas.
